# customer_details
this project is all about learning and growing own your own the command of the authorised peoples.
This was a great experience and i have learnt a lot with the help of this project.


It consist of login page where user can enter customer details and have funtionality to delete or update the users details.

In frontend I have used java, for backend I have used springboot, and all the data is saved in the database using MySql.
I have used crud operation to enhance it's funtionality.
Lastly I have used rest API to connect the frontend to the backend.

Thank you!
